To Compile:
Unzip the source code to any directory.  The source code includes a Makefile.

Type "make" at the command line to compile the program.

Type "make clean" to remove the compiled program and intermediate files.

To Run:

Place a file called "sequence.txt" in the same directory as the compiled program. 

Type ./CS421_Project2 at the command line.

The program will execute.  The program will print "Correct sequence" if sequence.txt contains the correct sequence of if-else statements.
